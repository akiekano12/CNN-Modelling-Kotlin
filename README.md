Object Detection Mobile Application
This Kotlin-based mobile application leverages cutting-edge Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in tandem with TensorFlow to perform real-time object detection and classification. Designed to enhance accessibility and user experience, the app processes captured or uploaded images, identifies objects, and provides auditory feedback by announcing the names of the detected items.

Key Features
Real-Time Object Detection: Utilizing a pre-trained CNN model, the app analyzes images with impressive speed and accuracy, recognizing multiple objects within the scene.
Audio Notifications: To improve usability, particularly for visually impaired users, the app converts classified objects into clear audio prompts, announcing the detected items.
Powered by TensorFlow: Efficient model processing and deployment on mobile devices ensure high performance even with complex image inputs, making the app smooth and responsive.
How It Works
Capture or Upload: Users can either take a photo or select one from their gallery.
CNN-based Image Processing: The app uses advanced CNN models to detect and classify objects.
Auditory Feedback: Once the objects are identified, the app reads their names aloud, providing an intuitive and hands-free interaction.
Why Itâ€™s Useful
This application empowers users, especially those with visual impairments, by providing real-time, audio-based object recognition. It seamlessly integrates advanced machine learning technology with a focus on accessibility, ensuring a more inclusive digital experience for everyone.
