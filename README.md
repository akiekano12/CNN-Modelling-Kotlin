This mobile application, developed using Kotlin, leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in combination with TensorFlow to perform real-time image detection and object classification. When a user captures or uploads an image, the application processes it using a pre-trained CNN model to identify objects within the image. The classified objects are then converted into audio notifications, providing auditory feedback by announcing the name of the detected objects.

This application is designed to enhance accessibility and user interaction by integrating advanced machine learning algorithms for image recognition. The use of CNN allows for high accuracy in object classification due to its ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features. TensorFlow facilitates efficient processing and deployment of the model on mobile platforms, ensuring smooth performance even with complex image inputs. The audio feedback component serves to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for users, particularly for those with visual impairments.
